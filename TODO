- BUG: props disappear when we're too close. Qt3D bug ?? Camera settings ?

- we badly use QSettings, no need to define a static or shared instance of
object QSetting. Because for each instanciation that's the same file read or written
and Qt knows where it is.

- see if we can spare resources with frustrum calling

- be more precise in include to reduce binary size

- implement ball rebounds, wall for clubs, back cross, back catch

- make leg class like arm

- add tr for translations

- implement shadows
